## Define the term "callback"

- Callback is a function that is called in response to another method

* **A callback** is a function that has been passed as an argument to another function

## Identify duplication that can be avoided with callbacks

- Callbacks can avoid duplication of code by offering a method that many other eventListeners / functions can use

## Pass a callback to a function

- Does passing a callback mean connecting a funciton to a callback?
  - Term is a little vauge, unless it means using a callback as an argument of a function

## Call a callback from within a function

- This can be done pretty easily, as long as the callback is scoped on the same level or a level above the function

## Pass data between functions and callbacks

- This can be done, but I am having a hard time imaging it

## Identify JavaScript's non-enforcement of arity

- Will learn this. Currenty do not know about arity
